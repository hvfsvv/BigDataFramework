    "##### Interpretation:\n",
    "**VWAP**: For each of our stocks, over the past 10 years or more, the price has been significantly higher than the VWAP. This reflects market dominance by buyers, in addition to an upward financial trend. Even though the stock prices are high (price > VWAP), this trend could suggest positive investor sentiment regarding these stocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also note the fluctuations observed primarily between 2010 and 2013. During certain periods, stock prices were below the VWAP, indicating that sellers controlled the market, and it wasn't a very favorable time to invest (on the contrary, this was a signal to sell).\n",
    "\n",
    "**MACD**: We observe a strong correlation between the different stocks based on the MACD indicator, particularly since 2020. The same peaks are visible on the curves of different stocks, suggesting that these stocks follow similar trends or react to the same market factors during this period. Although these stocks belong to different sectors, this synchronization could be related to global economic events, such as monetary and fiscal policies, the COVID-19 pandemic, and stimulus measures that affected multiple sectors similarly. This aligns with the results from the `correlation_df_values()` function, which revealed Pearson coefficients close to 1, indicating a very strong correlation between these stocks. (This observation is not visible due to limited resources on the notebook provided on datascientist.fr).\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of 2024, although AMZN, NVDA, GOOG, and MSFT stocks are declining, this could be a good time to invest. These companies are solid and leaders in their sectors, which may allow them to bounce back in the future. Buying at lower prices now could present good opportunities for gains when the market rebounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Analysis Note\n",
    "We observe that the VWAP indicator shows an upward trend, while the MACD fluctuates. The VWAP, as a volume-weighted average, reflects a stable trend and indicates continuous buying pressure when the price remains above this average. In contrast, the MACD fluctuates more because it measures the difference between two moving averages, making it more sensitive to short-term variations.\n"

    "##### Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "**OBV:**  \n",
    "By the end of 2024, we observe that for the stocks of **AMZN**, **MSFT**, **NVDA**, and **AAPL**, the OBV curve is rising. This indicates that investors are in a buying phase. In contrast, **GOOG** shows a slight decline, suggesting that investors are selling.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we also notice that the price curve and the OBV curve do not follow the same direction for **GOOG** and **MSFT** at the end of 2024. For **MSFT**, this divergence may suggest a future price increase, as the OBV continues to rise. On the other hand, for **GOOG**, the declining OBV might signal a potential drop in prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "When observing the OBV's evolution over time, we can see that these divergences between OBV and prices are relatively rare.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CMF:**  \n",
    "Over a 14-year period, we generally see positive values for the **Chaikin Money Flow (CMF)**. This indicates that, overall, investors are actively buying stocks, reflecting sustained buying pressure and an upward trend. However, it's important to note that during years marked by economic crises, the CMF indicator turned negative. For example, for **AMZN**, during 2021 and 2022, amidst the COVID-19 crisis, the CMF recorded negative values, suggesting a period of massive selling and increased selling pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding **NVDA**, at the end of 2024, the CMF indicator turns negative. This could indicate that, although prices are still relatively high, investors are beginning to lose interest in the stock, preferring to sell rather than buy. This could signal a trend reversal, with a potential drop in prices in the near future. For interested investors, it might be wise to monitor this development closely. A negative CMF value could also suggest that the stock is overvalued in the short term, potentially creating an investment opportunity if the price drops, making the stock more attractive for purchase at a lower price.\n",
    "\n",
    "**PVT:**  \n",
    "We can identify an upward trend in all of our stocks except **NVDA** by the end of 2024. This suggests that investors continue to support the stocks. For **NVDA**, this slight decline aligns with our observations from the previous indicator, **CMF**.\n"

    "## 5. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis of the results from the functions implemented in part 3 (Exploration): average_open_close_price() and daily_return_rate() alongside the analysis in part 4 (analysis and visualization) leads to the following conclusions:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, **AAPL** stands out significantly. The RSI indicator shows \"overbought\" market conditions, signaling strong demand. While this may seem a bit risky in the short term, it also indicates strong support from buyers. Other indicators, such as **PVT** and **OBV**, reinforce this idea by indicating strong buying pressure. Furthermore, **AAPL's** **ROC** is highly positive, showing sustained upward momentum. These combined signals suggest that **AAPL** is in a strong position to continue growing, offering an interesting opportunity for investors looking for a dynamic stock with solid potential in the short and medium term.\n",
    "\n",
    "**MSFT**, while showing a slightly more nuanced situation, is still a good choice. The indicators show mild consolidation, but its **ROC** near zero suggests that the stock might be in a waiting phase before another rise. The **VWAP** being above the current price and the **CMF** remaining positive suggest stability, which could lead to a rebound when conditions are favorable. Although less dynamic than **AAPL**, **MSFT** represents a solid and less risky option for investors, offering a good balance between return and moderate volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, **GOOG** and **NVDA** show concerning signals. For **GOOG**, the **ROC** is negative, indicating selling pressure and a possible \"oversold\" phase, suggesting that the stock might continue to struggle in the coming months. The **CMF** confirms this trend by suggesting that buyers are exiting. As a result, **GOOG's** returns are likely to remain less attractive in the short term, and a correction may extend. **NVDA**, meanwhile, presents a similar situation with a negative **ROC** and a declining **CMF**, also signaling selling pressure. While **NVDA** has shown high returns in the past, it remains the stock with the greatest potential for long-term returns, but it also carries significant risks. Investors will need to be prepared for some volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "**AMZN** is in an intermediate position. Returns are relatively stable, and although the **ROC** near zero signals a lack of clear direction, the **CMF** and **PVT** remain positive, suggesting stability. This could point to a period of consolidation before a potential rebound, but the short-term returns are not as promising as those of **AAPL** or **MSFT**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, **AAPL** and **MSFT** stand out as the best options for investment at the end of 2024. **AAPL** benefits from strong upward momentum supported by active buyers, while **MSFT** shows stability, which could translate into continuous growth, even though it is less volatile. In contrast, **GOOG** and **NVDA** present short-term risks due to selling pressure and negative returns, although long-term opportunities may arise if economic conditions improve.\n"
